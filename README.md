Mobile app similar to Google Photo


             Project requirements
1.Application wireframes and flow(i.e. which button/action leads to what page/activity )
2.Create your own web service and host it (like you did for e-commerce, yes, there is a plugin for it). Use this web service to:
  - Login with a user and password
  - upload a file from the mobile device storage or camera,  to the server
  - Get the list of uploaded files on the server and show it in the mobile device
  - Delete a file from the server
3.Read the accelerometer of the mobile device (OR, alternatively, interact via bluetooth with an embedded device such as arduino/raspbery PI, or a wearable smartwatch/or smartband)
4.Take a picture using the onboard camera (OR receive a sensor read from the embedded device)
5.Notify user to turn on wifi if it is off (OR notify user that bluetooth is off)
6.Use firebase cloud messaging service to send a notification to another device. Scenario: device 1 sends a message, a notification pops up on mobile device 2.
7.Invoke google maps service
  - Show an interactive map
  - Add your own custom markers to the map
  - Show directions to given location.
